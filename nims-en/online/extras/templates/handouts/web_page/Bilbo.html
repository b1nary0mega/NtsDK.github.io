					<p>So I live a long life. So I think my age is near over. Thats why I go to elves after my birthday. But I think speech disappearing wasn&#39;t brilliant idea. Seems the Ring goes to my finger itself.</p>

					<p>So much time I tell myself - don&#39;t listen Gandalf. But he persuades me again. Thats why I left my precious ring to Frodo. Oh, how it lives without me?</p>

					<p>I heard my nephew with several friends came to Rivendell. Brave guys. I hope Frodo visit me. Perhaps his journey only begin and couple items... are not very useful for me so I will give it to him. I&#39;m already in Rivendell. What a wonderful land.</p>

					<p>Frodo visited me and I gave the last part of inheritance - sword and mail. Sword and mail served me well. Now they will serve Frodo. When I saw the Ring I asked Frodo to give it to me for a second but he hide it. I became angry and again quiet very fast. I don&#39;t know what happen with me.</p>
