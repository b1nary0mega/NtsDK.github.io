NIMS is an editor for larpwriting. You create characters, write stories, prepare adaptations (character visions) and compile all this information to handout files. Also there are some extra tools: timeline, character filter, character groups, character relations, story investigation board and social networks drawing. NIMS is an interactive web page into two versions: single user offline version (ready for downloading) and multiuser online version (created by request). You need only web browser for using NIMS. NIMS is tested in Firefox and Chrome. Internet Explorer is not supported.

You can try NIMS 0.7.2 online by [link][nims-demo-en]. This is not a server version. This demo is an equivalent of offline version.
