					<p>The last strider&#39;s leader and the first king of joined kingdoms, direct descent of Elendil&#39;s royal blood (by Isildur line).</p>
<p>Aragorn became the greatest human of his age. He leaded the people of west against Sauron forces. He helped to destroy the One Ring (he was one of the ring fellowship). He joined Arnor and Gondor kingdoms.</p>

					<h4>Journey begins</h4>
					
					<div>
					September 30, 3018<br>
					<p>Hobbits company came to Bree. Hobbits are so awkward. I knew that they will come but I decided to wait a bit. Too bad I didn&#39;t come at once - Frodo bering the Ring in the hall centre. Now Sauron and nazguls definitely knows where to search them. One way or another I introduced myself took hobbits to other longing. It is obvious nazguls will visit the Prancing Pony this night.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					October 1, 3018<br>
					<p>We heard strange sounds and screams from the Prancing Pony. In the morning hobbits room was upside down and beds were pierced with swords. This time nazguls made a mistake. We need to go away from Bree.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					October 4, 3018<br>
					<p>I went to patrol for nothing. Nazguls stole by me. I drove them away hardly but they wounded Frodo. I could save him. Arwen came unexpectedly. She took Frodo from me. I hope black riders will not overtake them on the Rivendell way.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					October 20, 3018<br>
					<p>We went to Rivendell as far as we can. Fortunately Arwen successfully brought Frodo to Rivendell. We saw dead rider horses down the river. For some time nazguls will not bother us. Elves gave us a shelter. Gandalf is already in Rivendell. Elrond will heal Frodo. We will wait and when Frodo will be fine we will make the Ring council.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
				
					<h4>The fellowship of the Ring</h4>
					
					<div>

					<p>Council discuss the problem of destroying the Ring. Ring can be destroyed only in the Mount Doom. Nobody can do it. Frodo takes this task. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Gandalf and his Shire friends follow him. The fellowship of the Ring is created.</p>

					</div>
					<br>
