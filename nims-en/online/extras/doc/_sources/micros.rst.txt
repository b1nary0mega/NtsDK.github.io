Microthemes
===========

Some time ago we decided that page description in docs is not enough. Moreover there are many things out of the page functionality. By these reasons we introduce microthemes. Microtheme is a small task which NIMS user meets. NIMS pages become more complex but there are no reasons to know everything on each page. NIMS functions can be studied piece by piece. Microthemes list is formed from "simple and basic" to "complex and secondary".
