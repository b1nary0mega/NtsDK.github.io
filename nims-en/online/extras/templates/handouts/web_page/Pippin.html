					<h4>Journey begins</h4>
					
					<div>
					September 22, 3001<br>
					<p>Old man Bilbo made a wonderful party on his 111 birthday. Then he just disappeared from stage during his speech. Nobody understand what happens. And nobody see Bilbo in Shire anymore. Bilbo left all his things to Frodo.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					April 17, 3018<br>
					<p>I and Merry run away from angry farmer by the field and suddenly meet Frodo and Sam. They run with us. I don&#39;t think farmer will examine who is not guilty. We escaped from farmer and found the road and suddenly feel cold. We hide nearby and at this moment see the black rider. Frodo tells that there are several riders which search him and they go to Bree as fast as possible. We joined their company.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					September 30, 3018<br>
					<p>We came to the Prancing Pony. There was no Gangalf. We didn&#39;t know what to do and decided to stay overnight. Suddenly Frodo felt sick and disappeared the same way as Bilbo in birthday. We didn&#39;t understand what happen. We tried to find Frodo without success. Suddenly we saw human going away with Frodo. We went for him and prepare to fight. It emerged that this is Strider, Gandalf&#39;s friend and he will guard us. Strider said it is dangerous to stay overnight in the Prancing Pony so he lead us to other longing.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					October 1, 3018<br>
					<p>We heard strange sounds and screams from the Prancing Pony. In the morning hobbits room was upside down and beds were pierced with swords. I&#39;m very scared but I need to go with Frodo. He is in a big danger.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					October 4, 3018<br>
					<p>Strider went to patrol. Suddenly nazguls surrounded us. We tried to fight but they just throw us. They wounded me and finally Strider came back. Strider drove out nazguls. He tended to wound but suddenly we saw elven woman. So Rivendell was not far away. She took Frodo and rode to Rivendell. I hope Frodo will be fine.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					October 20, 3018<br>
					<p>We went to Rivendell as far as we can. Fortunately Arwen successfully brought Frodo to Rivendell. We saw dead rider horses down the river. For some time nazguls will not bother us. Elves gave us a shelter. Gandalf is already in Rivendell. Elrond will heal Frodo. We will wait for Frodo healing.</p>
